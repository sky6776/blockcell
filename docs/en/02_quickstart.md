# Article 02: Get Started with blockcell in 5 Minutes — From Installation to Your First Chat

> Series: *In-Depth Analysis of the Open Source Project “blockcell”* — Article 2
---

## Preface

In the previous article, we introduced what blockcell is. In this one, we’ll get hands-on and have it running within 5 minutes.

**What you need:**
- A macOS or Linux computer (Windows is also supported; this article uses macOS as the example)
- An LLM API key (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Kimi are all fine — we’ll cover how to choose)

---

## The fastest 5-minute path (follow these steps)

If you only want the quickest successful run, do these 4 steps:

1. Install: run the installer script
2. Configure: `blockcell setup` (interactive wizard; creates config and validates it)
3. Start: `blockcell agent` and send a test message
4. Start: `blockcell gateway`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:18791` for the WebUI

The rest of this article goes deeper (provider choices, multi-agent layout, common commands, FAQ, deployment suggestions).

---

## Step 1: Install

### Option A: One-line install script (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockcell-labs/blockcell/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, the `blockcell` command will be available under `~/.local/bin/`. If your shell can’t find it, add that path to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Option B: Build from source

If you want to compile it yourself (requires Rust 1.75+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockcell-labs/blockcell.git
cd blockcell/blockcell
cargo build --release
cp target/release/blockcell ~/.local/bin/
```

### Verify installation

```bash
blockcell --version
# blockcell 0.x.x
```

---

## Step 2: Configure (the `setup` wizard is recommended)

```bash
blockcell setup
```

This command will:
1. Create the `~/.blockcell/` directory structure
2. Let you choose an LLM provider
3. Save the API key and model
4. Optionally configure one external channel
5. Validate the saved provider configuration
6. Auto-bind a newly configured external channel to the `default` agent when no owner is set yet
7. If you later want one account / bot on the same channel to use a different agent, add `channelAccountOwners.<channel>.<accountId>`

The directory structure looks like this:

```
~/.blockcell/
├── config.json5          # Main config
├── sessions/            # Session history for the default agent
├── audit/               # Audit logs for the default agent
├── workspace/           # Default agent workspace
│   ├── memory/          # Memory database
│   ├── skills/          # User-installed skills
│   ├── media/           # Screenshots, audio, etc.
└── agents/              # Non-default agents (created on demand)
    └── ops/
        ├── sessions/
        ├── audit/
        └── workspace/
```

`default` keeps using the root `~/.blockcell/` layout. Additional agents live under `~/.blockcell/agents/<ID>/`.

If you prefer the older manual flow, you can still run:

```bash
blockcell onboard
```

---

## Step 3: Configure your API key

If you already completed `blockcell setup`, you can skip this step. Otherwise, open the config file:

```bash
# macOS
open ~/.blockcell/config.json5

# Or use a terminal editor
nano ~/.blockcell/config.json5
```

Find the `providers` section and fill in your API key.

### Option A: DeepSeek (cheap; recommended for beginners)

DeepSeek’s API is very inexpensive and great for testing:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "apiKey": "sk-your-deepseek-key",
      "apiBase": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "deepseek-chat"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: Kimi/Moonshot (stable access in China)

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "kimi": {
      "apiKey": "sk-your-kimi-key",
      "apiBase": "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "kimi/moonshot-v1-8k"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option C: OpenRouter (one key for many models)

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-your-openrouter-key",
      "apiBase": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option D: Ollama (fully local, free)

If you already have Ollama installed and pulled a model:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "ollama/llama3"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 4: Check status

```bash
blockcell status
```

Example output:

```
✓ Config loaded
✓ Provider: deepseek (deepseek-chat)
✓ Workspace: ~/.blockcell/workspace
✓ Memory: SQLite (0 items)
✓ Skills: 0 user skills, 44 builtin skills
✓ Channels: none configured
```

If you see a red ✗, the configuration has an issue — adjust it according to the hints.

---

## Step 5: Start chatting

```bash
blockcell agent
```

You’ll see a welcome screen:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║         blockcell agent              ║
║  Type /tasks to see background tasks ║
║  Type /quit to exit                  ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

You:
```

Now you can start chatting.

---

## Try these commands

### Basic chat

```
You: Hi, introduce yourself
```

### Ask the AI to search the web

```
You: Search for today’s AI-related news
```

The AI will call `web_search` and then use `web_fetch` to retrieve content.

### Read local files

```
You: Read ~/Desktop/report.txt and summarize the key points
```

> ⚠️ Note: when reading files outside the working directory (`~/.blockcell/workspace`), blockcell will prompt for confirmation and you must type `y`. This is a safety mechanism.

### Run commands

```
You: Show me the files in the current directory
```

The AI will call the `exec` tool to run `ls`.

### Write a file

```
You: Create hello.txt in the working directory with content "Hello from blockcell"
```

## Common CLI commands

Besides interactive `agent` mode, blockcell provides many useful commands:

```bash
# List all available tools

## Running into issues?

### Issue 1: Command not found

```bash
which blockcell
# If there’s no output, your PATH is not configured correctly
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue 2: API calls fail

```bash
blockcell doctor
# Checks network connectivity and API configuration
```

### Issue 3: Want to switch models

Edit `agents.defaults.model` in `config.json5`, then restart `blockcell agent`.

### Issue 4: Want to see which tools the AI used

In the chat, blockcell shows the tool name and parameters for each tool call. For more detailed logs:

```bash
blockcell logs --tail 50
```
